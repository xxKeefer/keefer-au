                    I love tech. They say any sufficiently advanced tech is like
                    magic to the uninitiated, and who doesn't want to be a
                    Wizard? I love to use React and Typescript to turn problems
                    into magic on the internet. Outside of tech, I have been
                    married to my highschool sweetheart for{' '}
                    {yearsSince('09-11-2013')} years and have two wonderful
                    daughters. I love to cook as a bit of a zen activity to
                    avoid burnout, my pickled onions are to die for. What's left
                    of my free time get spent telling stories with friends
                    through role playing games. Currently I enjoy helping one of
                    my best friends to develop a rules system for telling
                    stories called Omen.

                        My friend Ben is developing a new Table top RPG
                        influence by all the best parts of his favourite systems
                        designed to let the story be in the control of the
                        players and not the dice. It has already a very deep
                        rule set with lots of fun mechanics and I built him this
                        website so the rules could be easily accessed by our
                        friends who play. Built with Next.js and MDX

                        My friends were running a couple of leagues amongst our
                        selves and wanted a tool to help them manage their
                        teams. I built this tool to primarily make it easier for
                        us to make a cool little trainer card that displayed the
                        pokemon on each team. Built with React, styled with Ant
                        Design and deployed to Netlify.
